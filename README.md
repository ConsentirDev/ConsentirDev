## About Me

I am a dimension hopping charmeleon chasing the dopamine of knowledge and a perpetual student of IT architecture, cyber security, neuroscience and insert infinite other areas of interest. 

My humor is dark, Puns are my weapon of choice, and I wield them with deadly precision. I enjoy the rush of exploring new worlds (..hyperfocuses), and I never shy away from a challenge.

## Skills and Experience

I've been in the IT game for over 12 years, and I've seen it all. From mainframe systems to cloud computing, from firewalls to penetration testing, I know my way around the tech landscape. But it's not just technical skills that I bring to the table. I also have a keen eye for strategy, an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a passion for technology that keeps me ahead of the curve.

## Interests and Hobbies

When I am not dimension(**hobby**)-hopping, I spend my time indulging in the creative, singing, dancing, learning, climbing, and being a dad.

## What I care about

- **Ethical AI**

- **Designing for Neurodivergence**

- **Automating Everything**
